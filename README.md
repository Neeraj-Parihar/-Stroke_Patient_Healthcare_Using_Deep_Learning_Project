# **Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This project utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence in individuals. The work is organized into several key milestones:

1. **_Milestone 1:_** **Data Preprocessing**  
2. **_Milestone 2:_** **Data Visualization & Analysis**  
3. **_Milestone 3:_** **Data Encoding**  
4. **_Milestone 4:_** **Model Building, Evaluation, and Metrics Calculation (Precision, Accuracy, F1-Score)**  
5. **_Milestone 5:_** **UI Development Using Streamlit**

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring consistency across entries.
  - Addressed the class imbalance issue within the dataset.
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Explored patterns and correlations between features using visual tools.
  - Created visualizations to analyze class distribution and identify significant attributes influencing stroke risk.

- **Data Encoding**:
  - Transformed categorical variables into numerical formats using one-hot encoding and label encoding.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Built multiple models, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression.
  - Evaluated model performance through metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

- **User Interface with Streamlit**:
  - Developed a simple and interactive UI using Streamlit.
  - Added a **Generate** button, which, when clicked, displays the predicted result based on the model.

## **Dataset Overview**
<u>Key Features:</u>
- **Target Variable**: Stroke occurrence (binary: 0 = No Stroke, 1 = Stroke).
- **Class Imbalance**: 95% of the instances are labeled as "No Stroke," while 5% are labeled as "Stroke."
- **Features**: Includes variables like age, gender, BMI, hypertension, etc.

---

## **Challenges Faced**
1. **Class Imbalance**:  
   - The dataset is imbalanced, making it difficult for models to detect stroke cases.
   
2. **Metric Selection**:  
   - Accuracy alone was not sufficient due to the imbalance; recall and F1-score were emphasized for a better evaluation of stroke detection.

## **Milestone Breakdown**
### **_Milestone 1:_ Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and scaling numerical features.

### **_Milestone 2:_ Data Visualization**
- Explored and visualized the dataset to understand the distribution of classes and correlations among features.

### **_Milestone 3:_ Data Encoding**
- Applied one-hot encoding and label encoding to transform categorical variables.
- Normalized features to improve model performance.

### **_Milestone 4:_ Model Building & Evaluation**
- Built and evaluated Ridge, Lasso, Logistic, and Linear Regression models.
- Performance Insights:
  - Achieved high accuracy (**92.46%**) but struggled with stroke detection due to poor recall.
  - F1-scores highlighted the imbalance between precision and recall.

### **_Milestone 5:_ UI Development with Streamlit**
- Created an interactive UI using Streamlit to visualize results.
- Added a **Generate** button that triggers the model to predict stroke risk and display the result on the webpage.

## **Future Directions**
- **Class Balancing**:
  - Implement techniques such as SMOTE or undersampling to address class imbalance.
  
- **Model Enhancements**:
  - Experiment with more sophisticated models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or ensemble methods to improve prediction accuracy and recall.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Derive additional features from existing data to boost model performance and make predictions more reliable.
